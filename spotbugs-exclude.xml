    <!--
    Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the object's fields exposes
    the internal representation of the object.  If instances are accessed by untrusted code,
    and unchecked changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important
    properties, you will need to do something different. Returning a new copy of the object is
    better approach in many situations.
    We have getters on our internal fields. Questionable, but out of findbugs scope. Returning a
    copy is not practical in most cases.
